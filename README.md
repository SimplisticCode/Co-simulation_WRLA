# Co-simulation in Maude
This respository contains the formalization of co-simulations algorithms and executions in Maude defined by the FMI 2.0 standard.

The model is developed in an object-oriented style that requires full-maude.

The respository contains three files:
* WRLA.maude: contains the developed model
* scenarios.maude: contains the scenarios and commands to test the model.
* A technical report assisting the paper handed in to WRLA 2022.
